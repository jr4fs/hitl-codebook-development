**Human-in-the-loop codebook development for LLM-assisted text annotation.**

Annotation Assistant turns the human effort in large-scale text labeling from
*annotating every example* into *teaching the model how to label*. You review a
small, representative sample of your data alongside an LLM's predictions; every
correction is distilled into an explicit, versioned **codebook** of rules that
guides the model on the rest of the corpus. The result is a validated, exportable
labeling policy — not just a labeled file — that can drive annotation at scale.

## Key features

- **Guided sampling.** Representative + coverage sampling over sentence embeddings
  selects a diverse "guide set" from a large unlabeled pool, so a small review
  budget covers the data distribution.
- **Co-annotation loop.** Review the LLM's label, key span, and reasoning per
  sample; mark correct/incorrect and add feedback. After each batch the model
  **synthesizes new rules** into a live codebook.
- **Continuous evaluation.** Track F1 on the examples reviewed so far and F1 on a
  held-out validation set; run a full evaluation any time.
- **Exportable codebook** ready to power downstream annotation, plus one-click
  inference over the entire dataset.
- **Provider-agnostic.** LLM via OpenRouter or local Ollama; embeddings via
  OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, or in-process (mpnet) — switchable with env vars.
- **Interactive demo** at the `/demo` route (fully mocked, no backend or keys).

## How it works

1. **Upload** a labeled validation set, an unlabeled pool, and task + label
   definitions (a ready-made sample bundle is downloadable in the app, see
   [`sample_dataset/`](./sample_dataset)).
2. **Sample** a guide set within your review *budget*.
3. **Review** AI suggestions batch by batch; correct mistakes and give feedback.
4. **Synthesize** rules automatically after each batch into the live codebook.
5. **Evaluate** on the held-out set; iterate until quality is sufficient.
6. **Export** the codebook and, optionally, run inference over the full dataset.

## Quickstart

| Goal | Guide |
|------|-------|
| Develop locally with hot reload | [docs/local-dev.md](./docs/local-dev.md) |
| Run the full stack in Docker | [docs/deploy-docker.md](./docs/deploy-docker.md) |
| Deploy to AWS (one script) | [docs/deploy-aws.md](./docs/deploy-aws.md) |

All services read a single repo-root `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`). The sampling
methodology is documented in [docs/sampling_methodology.md](./docs/sampling_methodology.md).

### Local dev with Ollama instead of OpenRouter

[docs/local-dev.md](./docs/local-dev.md) defaults to OpenRouter for LLM
inference. To run without an API key, point the app at a local
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) server:

```bash
brew install ollama && ollama serve   # or your platform's installer
ollama pull mistral:7b                # + any other models you'll use
```

Then in `.env`: `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` defaults to
`http://localhost:11434`, no change needed for native dev). Check the
Ollama-side model tags in
[`pybackend/models/ollama_adapter.py`](./pybackend/models/ollama_adapter.py)
before pulling — `gemma3:1b` and `qwen3.5:2b` may not match Ollama's registry
names. A laptop without a discrete GPU will run the larger models
(`qwen:32b`, `llama3.3:70b`) slowly.

### Data privacy: keeping private data fully local

With the right `.env` values, no annotation text ever leaves your machine:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=local
DB_CONN_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017
# no OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, or AWS/BEDROCK_* keys set
```

- **LLM inference** goes to `localhost:11434` (Ollama) — switches to
  `openrouter.ai` only if you set `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter`.
- **Embeddings** run in-process via `sentence-transformers` — only call
  OpenAI or Bedrock if `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER` is explicitly set to `openai`
  or `bedrock`.
- **Anonymization** (Presidio + spaCy) and **file storage**
  (`shared_uploads/`, etc.) are both local disk/in-process — no S3 or other
  upload path exists in the code.
- No analytics/telemetry SDKs are present anywhere in the stack.
- If Ollama or local MongoDB is unreachable, requests fail loudly rather
  than silently falling back to a cloud provider.

**Watch out:** [`.env.example`](./.env.example) ships with
`LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` and `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai` as example
production values. If you `cp .env.example .env` and add real API keys
without changing those two lines, your data *will* go to OpenRouter/OpenAI.
For a fully local, private setup you must explicitly set both to `ollama`
and `local` as shown above.

## Implementation details

- **Software stack.** React (Vite) single-page frontend, a Node/Express
  backend-for-frontend (authentication, task management, file storage, ML proxy),
  and a Python/FastAPI ML service (embeddings, sampling, anonymization, LLM calls).
  Shared TypeScript types; MongoDB for persistence.
- **Deployment (Docker + AWS).** Containerized with Docker Compose and provisioned
  on AWS with Terraform via a single idempotent `deploy.sh` (EC2 + Elastic IP,
  Caddy auto-HTTPS). The same stack runs locally with one Docker command.
- **Open-source & reproducible.** Fully open-source and reproducible from a single
  repo-root `.env` plus one-command Docker or Terraform-driven deploys; seeded
  sampling and versioned, exportable codebooks make runs repeatable.
- **Retrieval & memory.** The unlabeled pool is embedded (sentence-transformer
  mpnet or an embeddings API) and indexed in **FAISS**; representative + coverage
  sampling retrieves a diverse guide set. Synthesized rules accumulate in a
  persistent codebook that is fed back into later prompts as long-term memory.
- **Parallelization & optimizations.** Blocking LLM/embedding calls are offloaded
  from the event loop and batched under a bounded-concurrency semaphore; the
  candidate pool can be subsampled before embedding; sampling jobs are queued
  (FIFO) behind a memory guard; validation and full-dataset inference fan out
  concurrently; and large dataset uploads are gzip-compressed.
- **Data storage & APIs** — switchable via env (`LLM_PROVIDER`,
  `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER`, `DB_CONN_STRING`), with three target environments:
  - **Public AWS deployment** — MongoDB Atlas, OpenRouter (LLM), and OpenAI or
    Amazon Bedrock (embeddings), behind Caddy auto-HTTPS on a single EC2 VM.
  - **Hosted on CARC** — the same containers run on the CARC research-computing
    cluster for institutionally hosted compute and data.
  - **Local with Ollama** — MongoDB in a container, LLM inference via a local
    Ollama server, and embeddings computed in-process (mpnet); no external API
    keys or data egress.
